# FPS game made on Unity 

## Context 
This project dates back to September 2021.

It has been realized in collaboration with [Julien Withfield](https://github.com/thekidvoomer) within the scope of the course *CS412/512 - Computer Games Design*  during my exchange semester at Bishop's University, Canada.

## Software

The game has been developped and tested under Unity version **2021.3.8f1 LTS** / JetBrains Rider 2021

## Description

This is a FPS survival game.

The point of the game is to survive for as long as possible while killing as many enemies as possible. Enemies spawn around the player.
If one is killed, another spawns. Therefore the game only ends when the player dies. 
The score is determined by how many enemies are killed. The game gets progressively harder as it goes on, the enemies gain in speed. The player only has 4 health points, that do not come back. 

## How to execute

Simply download the lastest release, unzip the build and use the executable in it.
